/*
There are a lot of exciting classes offered in our region. We wrote a small
script that checks which ones are still upcoming and compatible with our
calendar. We must be available to attend all sessions of a particular class
in order to sign up for it. We can always arrange that on weekends, but for
weekdays we have to check whether our calendar is free.

Although the code below runs, something is wrong with it. Why is everything
except for the Back To The Future Movie Night in the list of compatible classes?

// my answer:
function toString(date) {
  let month = String(date.getMonth()+1);
  month = month.length < 2 ? '0' + month : month;
  let day = String(date.getDate());
  day = day.length < 2 ? '0' + day : day;
  return `${date.getFullYear()}-${month}-${day}`;
}

/*
LS Solution:
In order to make the above code work, we have to fix the function
that converts dates to strings:

function toString(date) {
  function pad(string, n) {
    while (string.length < n) {
      string = `0${string}`;
    }

    return string;
  }

  const year  = String(date.getFullYear());
  const month = pad(String(date.getMonth() + 1), 2);
  const day   = pad(String(date.getDate()), 2);

  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}

Our original toString() function had several problems, causing isAvailable()
to return true for all class dates that were passed in as arguments.
We addressed the following problems when we refactored our toString() function:

The getYear() method is deprecated, as it returns a "number representing the
year of the given date, according to local time, minus 1900", which is often
not that useful. Instead, we want to use getFullYear(), which returns 2018 for
our dates, as expected.

getMonth() returns a zero-based value, with 0 representing the first month of
the year. To format our date string correctly, we must add 1 to the return
value of getMonth().

The getDay() method returns an integer from 0 to 6, indicating the day of
the week (with 0 being Sunday, 1 being Monday, and so on).
We use it to this end in our isWeekday function. In order to get the day of
the month, however, we have to use getDate().

In the date strings we use as keys in our calendar, months and days are
padded with leading zeros. So when converting a date into our target string
format, we have to make sure we get 2018-08-05 and not 2018-8-5.
